-- The totality law (spec §4): every step in every feature matches EXACTLY
-- ONE definition, or CI fails naming the offenders. Under R23, a
-- definition's answer for one body is one of THREE outcomes (World.Claim:
-- NoMatch / ClaimError / Matched), and "exactly one" is a law about how
-- many definitions MATCH, not how many merely claim:
--   0 definitions MATCH, 0 claim  -> an orphan (nobody defines it)
--   0 definitions MATCH, 1+ claim -> a value error (recognized shape,
--                                    bad value — a THIRD class, distinct
--                                    from both orphan and ambiguous; see
--                                    `classify` below)
--   1 definition MATCHES          -> fine, the law holds (any number of
--                                    other definitions merely claiming it
--                                    does not matter — a full match wins)
--   2+ definitions MATCH          -> ambiguous (more than one truly
--                                    claims to run this line)
-- `classify` is the one place a step becomes one of these outcomes;
-- `orphans`, `ambiguous`, and `valueErrors` are just filters over it, and
-- `checkDir` reports all three from a single traversal.

-- | How one step fares under the totality law, or Nothing if it holds
-- (exactly one definition matches it, regardless of how many others
-- merely claim it).

  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- `body`'s holes get substituted with a fixed example value before
-- matching (see Prop.substituteExamples) -- but ONLY when `isProperty`
-- says the enclosing scenario is @property-tagged, because that is
-- exactly the condition under which `Prop.runWithProperties` will ever
-- actually substitute anything at run time (see its `run1`: an untagged
-- scenario runs through plain `runScenario`, which never substitutes).
-- Getting this gate wrong in either direction breaks the law:
--   * substitute unconditionally (the pre-fix behavior) and an untagged
--     scenario that accidentally contains a hole is reported CLEAN by
--     `check` while running, for real, on the literal unresolved
--     "<hole>" text -- a static verdict that lies about the dynamic one.
--   * never substitute and every @property scenario's holes reach their
--     captures as raw "<hole>" text, which is only caught when the
--     capture in question happens to validate its input -- exactly the
--     "artifact of which captures happen to validate" trap this whole
--     mechanism exists to close (concretely: "<someYear>" contains no
--     whitespace, so UrlPath accepts it unexamined; once a "GET {url} as
--     {name}" step exists, that would silently fetch a URL containing
--     the literal text "<someYear>", never a real year).
--
-- An UNREGISTERED hole is a stronger, tag-independent law: scanning the
-- RAW body (before any substitution) for a "<hole>" whose name is not in
-- Prop.holeRegistry and forcing VOrphan on it, regardless of what any
-- definition's capture would have done with the literal text, is what
-- makes "never silently pass" actually true -- a hole is either bound to
-- a real generator or the step is unconditionally undefined, the same
-- as any other never-implemented step.
--
-- Review finding (round 1, Important): the gate itself is no longer
-- decided here. It was duplicated -- `Vocab.expectedVocab` re-expressed
-- the identical rule in its own words -- so it now lives in ONE exported
-- function, `Prop.deholeFor`, called by both. This comment keeps the
-- REASONING (it is the fuller of the two, and it belongs with the
-- totality law it was written for); `Prop.deholeFor` holds the decision.
-- The parameter is the enclosing scenario's tags rather than a
-- pre-computed Bool, so the shared function -- not each caller -- is what
-- turns tags into a substitution.
