-- Reused rather than duplicated: `module Check where` carries no export
-- list, so `featureFilesLocal` is already exposed, and Vocab -> Check
-- introduces no cycle (Check never imports Vocab or Main -- only Main
-- imports both). Task 7's own comment on this walker explains why IT
-- duplicated Main's copy (Main imports Check, so Check -> Main would be
-- a cycle); that reasoning doesn't apply a second time in this direction,
-- so a second copy here would just be needless duplication, not a cycle
-- avoided.

-- The union of universes contributed by the definitions this feature's
-- steps actually MATCH -- THE source the table must equal. "Matched", not
-- merely "claimed": World.Claim has three states (R23) and a definition
-- that only recognizes a line's shape but fails to parse the value
-- (ClaimError) contributes nothing here, exactly as Check.hs's totality
-- law counts only full matches, not mere claims, toward "exactly one".
--
-- Described universes are excluded STRUCTURALLY, by matching on the
-- Universe constructor, not by a hardcoded list of capture names. A
-- Described universe (FixtureRef's "a named answer in fixtures/, ...",
-- BindName's "a scene name to bind, ...", FixtureRefFreeText's free text,
-- and UrlPath's "a URL path with no embedded whitespace, ..." -- new
-- since this task was scoped) is prose the capture's author wrote to
-- explain a free-form value; it is not a finite or bounded vocabulary a
-- dummy must learn before writing a scenario, the way an Enumerated set
-- of pieces/styles or a Ranged year window is. UrlPath is excluded on
-- exactly the same structural grounds as "name" and "text" -- not a
-- special case bolted on for it, an instance of the general rule.
-- FixtureRef's Described universe is handled the SAME way (excluded):
-- its prose ("a named answer in fixtures/, e.g. ...") is worth writing
-- once at the type's definition for a reader who wonders what a
-- @fixture@ capture even is, but it is not a closed vocabulary either --
-- there is no finite list of legal fixture names to enumerate in a
-- feature's table, so a Vocabulary row for it would just repeat the same
-- prose sentence in every feature that uses it, never a real answer set.
--
-- The sweep: a hole is substituted with its example value before
-- matching, through `Prop.deholeFor` -- the SAME function Check.classify
-- calls, not a second copy of its rule (review finding, round 1: these
-- were two independent re-expressions of one gate, which would have
-- diverged silently into a wrong Vocabulary block rather than a red
-- test). Without this substitution, a scenario body reading
-- "I render pieces <somePieces> at year <someYear> in style <someStyle>"
-- MATCHES no definition at all (its PieceSet capture cannot parse
-- "<somePieces>"), contributes no universe, and a feature file whose
-- every scenario is quantified therefore derives an EMPTY table -- so
-- `vocab --write` deletes the block, and a reader of
-- scene/resources.feature is left with no statement of what a piece, a
-- year or a style even is, precisely because those laws were
-- generalized to range over all of them. Nothing about the vocabulary a
-- reader needs changed when the values became generated; only the
-- literal text did. Getting the gate wrong in either direction has the
-- mirror-image consequences Check.hs's own comment spells out -- which
-- is exactly why the decision is shared rather than restated here.

-- ---------- surgical --write (controller ruling R34) ----------
-- --write must touch ONLY the Vocabulary block. parseFeature/renderFeature
-- round-trip the WHOLE file: renderFeature reflows every preamble line
-- through its own formatting, and parseFeature drops blank lines within a
-- preamble outright (see Gherkin.Parse's `isComment`) -- both fine for the
-- round-trip LAW those two functions are pinned against (Spec.hs's
-- "round-trips: parse . render == Right"), both hostile to a hand-written
-- corpus a human owns. So writing here never calls renderFeature: it
-- works at the raw-line level, locates the existing "  Vocabulary:" block
-- (if any) using the same line classification the parser itself uses
-- (blank / a tag line / a "Scenario: " line / a "Vocabulary:" header / a
-- table row), replaces exactly that span -- or inserts a fresh block at
-- the same point the parser would have accepted one, if there is no
-- block yet -- and leaves every other line byte-for-byte untouched.

-- A table row, by the same shape Gherkin.Parse's (private, unexported)
-- `tableRow` accepts: "|"-wrapped, non-empty inside. Deliberately
-- duplicated rather than shared: `tableRow` lives in `Gherkin.Parse`'s own
-- `where` clause, and widening that module's exports just to share an
-- 8-character predicate would be a worse trade than the duplication.
-- The coupling runs BOTH ways and is currently inert, not just one-way:
-- if `Gherkin.Parse`'s row grammar ever changes, this must change with
-- it, or `vocabRegion` could mis-locate an existing block's extent; and
-- conversely, this module can't unilaterally recognize a WIDER row shape
-- than the parser does, since `spliceVocab` only ever runs on text that
-- `parseFeature` has already accepted (see `vocabDir`'s `one`) — a row
-- shape the parser wouldn't recognize can't reach here parsed as a
-- feature in the first place, which is what makes today's duplication
-- inert rather than a live drift risk.
isTableRow :: Text -> Bool
isTableRow l =

-- Where a preamble (and therefore any Vocabulary block within it) ends: a
-- tag line or the first Scenario line -- and ONLY those. Mirrors
-- Gherkin.Parse's own `goBody` dispatch exactly: `isComment` treats a
-- blank line as skippable filler, same as a "#" comment, and `goBody`
-- simply continues past it without ever treating it as the end of the
-- preamble -- a blank line can (and, per renderFeature's own convention,
-- normally does) sit BETWEEN the preamble prose and a "Vocabulary:"
-- header, so treating blank-as-boundary would stop the scan before ever
-- reaching a real block that comes right after one.
isBoundary :: Text -> Bool
isBoundary l =
  let s = T.strip l in "@" `T.isPrefixOf` s || "Scenario: " `T.isPrefixOf` s

-- Skip the FEATURE-level header (any leading comment/blank lines, any
-- FEATURE-level tag line such as "@smoke" before "Feature: ...", and the
-- "Feature: " line itself) before hunting for a boundary. Mirrors
-- Gherkin.Parse's `go0`. Without this, a feature-level tag line at the
-- very top of the file (which also starts with "@", same as a scenario
-- tag) would satisfy `isBoundary` immediately at index 0 and make
-- `vocabRegion` insert a fresh block before the tag line -- i.e. before
-- the Feature: line itself.
skipHeader :: [Text] -> Int
skipHeader ls = go 0
  where
    n = length ls
    go i

      | "Feature: " `T.isPrefixOf` T.strip (ls !! i) = i + 1
      | otherwise = i + 1 -- malformed; parseFeature already rejected this

-- Right (start, end): an existing Vocabulary block spans raw line indices
-- [start, end) (the header line through its last contiguous table row).
-- Left i: no block exists yet; one belongs right before index i (the
-- first boundary line reached, after the Feature-level header, without
-- ever seeing a "Vocabulary:" header). The title and any preamble prose
-- lines are neither a vocabulary header nor a boundary, so the scan
-- simply passes over them.
--
-- Both the insertion index (Left) AND an existing header's own index
-- (Right) back up over any contiguous run of blank lines immediately
-- before them: `renderRows` always supplies its OWN leading blank line,
-- so replacing/inserting right AT the anchor would either glue the new
-- block straight onto whatever precedes it with no separating blank at
-- all (if there were none originally), or stack a second blank on top of
-- one that already served that job (the ordinary case in this corpus:
-- prose, blank, "Vocabulary:" -- or, with no block yet, prose, blank,
-- Scenario). Backing up folds that pre-existing blank into the replaced
-- span instead, so the result reads exactly like renderFeature's own
-- convention -- one blank before the header, one blank after the rows --
-- without ever duplicating a line that was already there.

    -- contiguous run of COMMENT lines glued directly to the anchor.
    --
    -- The comment half was a real defect, found the moment the step
    -- phase gave two previously block-less files a vocabulary: in
    -- scene/detail.feature the anchor is a "@property" tag line with two
    -- "# Characterization: ..." lines immediately above it and a blank
    -- above those. A comment is neither a blank nor a boundary, so the
    -- scan passed straight over it and inserted the block AT the tag --
    -- between a scenario's own note and the scenario, orphaning the
    -- comment above a table it has nothing to do with. Byte-surgical,
    -- and still wrong: the owner writes those notes, and a tool that
    -- silently cuts one away from what it annotates is not one to run on
    -- a hand-written corpus.
    --
    -- "Contiguous with the anchor" is what keeps this narrow. A comment
    -- separated from the scenario by a blank line is preamble prose and
    -- stays put; only a comment glued to the boundary travels with it,
    -- which is the same convention a reader uses.
    -- TWO phases, in this order, and not one mixed loop: comments
    -- first, then blanks. A single loop that accepted either would keep
    -- walking past the blank ABOVE a glued comment and swallow whatever
    -- comment sits above THAT -- in a file with a free-standing preamble
    -- note and a scenario note, it hoists the block above both and
    -- reorders the author's prose. Comments travel with the anchor only
    -- while they are glued to it; the blank run is then folded in
    -- exactly as before, because `renderRows` supplies its own leading
    -- blank.

-- The block's own text, in renderFeature's exact format (blank line, the

-- a block and a file whose block this function just replaced end up
-- indistinguishable. An empty vocabulary renders as no block at all
-- (nothing to insert; an existing block whose replacement is empty is
-- simply deleted -- not reachable from any feature in the current corpus,

-- out, but handled the same way renderFeature itself treats an empty

-- `T.lines`/`T.unlines` are not inverse: `T.lines "a\nb"` and

-- distinction is thrown away on the way in), while `T.unlines` always
-- reappends one on the way out. Splicing through `T.lines` and
-- reassembling with a blanket `T.unlines` would therefore silently ADD a
-- trailing newline to any corpus file that lacked one, which is exactly
-- the kind of stray byte the surgical requirement forbids -- true today
-- only because all twelve corpus files happen to already end in "\n"
-- (verified directly, and now pinned by a test below rather than left as
-- an untested aside). `joinLines` carries that one bit explicitly instead
-- of relying on `T.unlines`'s fixed opinion, so the reassembled text
-- has a trailing newline if and only if the ORIGINAL did.

-- Review finding (round 3, controller ruling): this used to be a SINGLE
-- pass -- `mapM one files`, where `one` read, parsed, and (in write mode)
-- WROTE each file in the same breath, with the aggregate parse-error
-- check only happening after every file's `one` action had already run.
-- That meant a directory with one malformed feature among several good
-- ones would genuinely rewrite the good files' bytes on disk BEFORE
-- reporting the parse failure and exiting non-zero -- a partial write on
-- a failed run, which is exactly the half-applied state the surgical
-- requirement exists to prevent (a tool that sometimes stamps some of the
-- owner's hand-written corpus and sometimes doesn't, depending on which
-- OTHER file happens to be broken, is not trustworthy to run at all).
--
-- Fixed structurally, not just with a test: `vocabDir` is now genuinely
-- two phases, sequenced by Haskell's own data dependency (phase 2 cannot
-- run without phase 1's result) rather than by convention. Phase 1
-- (`readAndParse`) reads and parses EVERY file and produces nothing but
-- data -- no write, ever, happens here. Only after ALL of phase 1 has
-- completed does `vocabDir` decide whether ANY file failed to parse; if
-- so, it reports every failure and exits, having touched no file's bytes
-- at all. Phase 2 (`writeOne` / the drift computation) runs only on the
-- `goods` list, and only after that all-clear -- so a single malformed
-- feature now makes --write a strict no-op across the WHOLE directory,
-- not a partial one.
