# Bible Atlas UX Contract

Any implementation of the Bible Atlas UI MUST expose the surfaces below.
The UX property suite couples ONLY to this contract (plus the HTTP API).

## URL patterns
- `/` — reader, defaults to GEN 1
- `/read/{BOOK}/{chapter}` — reader deep link (BOOK = canonical 3-letter code)
- `/read/{BOOK}/{chapter}#v{n}` — verse anchor
- `/world?from={year}&to={year}` — time mode (signed years, no zero)
- `/world?ref={REF}` — scripture mode (canonical ref)
- `/world` (no `from`/`to`/`ref` at all) — defaults to the `gospels` era's
  exact window (`[-5, 29]`, see `data/curated/eras.toml`)

## Displayed text formats
- Year: `1447 BC` or `AD 30`
- Range: `1447 BC – 1400 BC` (spaced en dash U+2013); single year shown as the year alone
- Canonical refs: `GEN`, `GEN.1`, `GEN.1.1`, `GEN.1.1-5`

## data-testid inventory
Header: `nav-reader`, `nav-world`, `translation-select`, `attribution`
World: `world-map`, `marker-{placeId}`, `place-card`, `place-card-title`,
  `hover-verse-{VREF}` (one element per currently shown verse, VREF = canonical id e.g.
  `EXO.14.21`, whether it renders as its own lone-verse row or as one verse inside a
  passage block; element text contains that verse's own KJV text verbatim -- never
  trimmed, never paraphrased), `hover-passage-{SPAN}` (one per currently shown passage
  block -- a maximal run of >=2 consecutive same-book/chapter verses; SPAN = canonical
  span text of that run's CURRENTLY SHOWN extent, e.g. `GEN.12.1-4`; contains that
  block's own `hover-verse-{VREF}` elements), `place-card-more` (button; present only
  while unshown verses remain for this place), `place-card-collapse` (button; present
  only while more than the initial content is shown),
  `place-card-blurb` (batch-e-brief.md; present only when the API's `history.blurb`
  is non-null for the card's place under the scene's own window -- text is that
  blurb's text verbatim), `place-card-dates` (present only when the place has a
  curated `established` and/or `destroyed` date; wraps one or both of
  `place-card-date-established` / `place-card-date-destroyed`, each a button whose
  text contains that date's own formatted year/range and which opens the
  ExplorerPopover, listing the curated supporting verses first, on click),
  `arrows-svg`, `arrow-{narrativeId}-{order}` (SVG path; attr `stroke` = narrative color;
  attr `data-faded` = "true"|"false"; `marker-end` set),
  `legend`, `legend-item-{narrativeId}` (button; `aria-pressed` = isolated),
  `slider`, `slider-readout` (an `<input>`, accepts typed year/range text, Enter applies),
  `slider-era-{eraId}` (clickable era label; attr `data-active` = "true" when the
  currently-applied window overlaps this era's own `[from_year, to_year]`, "false"
  otherwise -- clicking an era band applies that era's own exact range, which, because
  era ranges are contiguous and non-overlapping by construction, always leaves exactly
  that one era's `data-active` "true" and every other era's "false"),
  `mode-chip` (text contains active ref),
  `mode-chip-return`,
  `arrow-tip` (visible while an arrow is hovered; text contains the narrative name),
  `toast` (non-blocking error notice; last good scene stays rendered beneath it),
  `border-tag` (visible in time mode when a border snapshot is loaded; text contains
  "Borders c."; hidden in scripture mode and whenever no snapshot is loaded),
  `landmark-{slug}` (always-visible, non-interactive landmark label; slug = lowercase
  kebab-case of the landmark's name, e.g. "Mount Sinai" -> "mount-sinai"),
  `polity-label-{slug}` (non-interactive polity-name label rendered from the
  active border snapshot's own features; slug = lowercase kebab-case of the
  feature's `name`, same rule as `landmark-{slug}`; visible in time mode
  only, subject to its own per-feature zoom/viewport visibility rule --
  absent entirely whenever no border snapshot is loaded, e.g. scripture mode)
Picker (ScripturePicker, shared by world and reader):
  `picker-book` (select of 66 books), `picker-chapter` (select sized from TOC),
  `picker-verse-from`, `picker-verse-to` (numeric inputs bounded by TOC),
  `picker-apply` (button; composes the canonical ref)
Reader: `reader-root`, `verse-line-{n}`, `verse-num-{n}`, `verse-explore-{n}`,
  `reader-prev`, `reader-next`, `passage-chip`
Popover (shared): `popover`, `popover-title`, `popover-breadcrumb-back`,
  `popover-chip-xrefs`, `popover-chip-map`, `popover-chip-book`, `popover-chip-context`,
  `popover-chip-verse-{VREF}` (batch-e-brief.md; one per a `YearNode`'s own curated
  supporting verses, in curated order, ALWAYS rendered before that same node's
  `popover-chip-map` chip -- DATE-1: opening a date's popover lists its supporting
  verses first),
  `xref-item-{TARGET}` (TARGET = canonical ref/span text), `mini-map`, `mini-map-open-world`
Notes:
- `marker-{placeId}` elements carry the visible place label -- batch-e-brief.md:
  this is the scene's own `display_name` (the period name resolved for the
  scene's current window when the place has curated history and one of its
  name ranges intersects that window, else its plain default name), not
  always the place's plain default name. `place-card-title` and the
  `arrow-tip` text (`{narrative}: {fromName} -> {toName}`) use the SAME
  `display_name`, so a place's name is never shown two different ways at
  once within one scene.
- NAME-1 (batch-e-brief.md): for a time-mode window fully inside one curated
  name range, `marker-{placeId}`'s label and `place-card-title` both equal
  that name; a window crossing the boundary between two curated ranges
  shows whichever one covers the window's own midpoint (or, failing that,
  the later-starting one it still intersects); a window matching no curated
  range falls back to the place's plain default name. Scripture mode always
  shows the plain default name (no curated period name is ever resolved
  there -- there is no time window to resolve one against).
- BLURB-1 (batch-e-brief.md): `place-card-blurb` shows at most one blurb,
  never a stack -- a window inside exactly one of a place's own `"era"`-
  breadth ranges shows that blurb; a window spanning more than one of them
  shows a `"broad"`-breadth blurb instead (falling back to an `"era"` pick
  if no `"broad"` blurb is curated); a window matching nothing shows no
  `place-card-blurb` at all.
- Hover place card content (batch-d-brief.md): the card is place name + verse
  content + controls, nothing else -- no per-(book,chapter) count rows, bare
  canonical-ref rows, or chapter-identifier lines anywhere on it. From the
  place's merged, deduped activating verse list (event order, then each
  event's own already book/chapter/verse-ascending groups -- this list's
  long-standing "canonical order"), maximal runs of consecutive same-book/
  chapter verses (n, n+1, ...) are passages (`hover-passage-{SPAN}`, rendered
  as one flowing block); runs of one are lone verses. Initial state shows up
  to the first 4 verses if the first group is a passage, else the first 2
  verses (necessarily non-consecutive with each other, since the first group
  being a lone verse means the very next verse in the list isn't consecutive
  with it) -- only ever the first group (passage) or the first two lone
  verses, never more, never a wall. Each `place-card-more` click reveals the
  next chunk: +5 verses if the next not-yet-shown verse belongs to a
  passage-sized group, +2 if it belongs to a lone verse's group; repeats
  until the place's full (already server-capped) verse list is exhausted, at
  which point `place-card-more` is absent. `place-card-collapse` restores the
  exact initial state (DOM and card size) in one click.
- Scene pseudo-events with ids beginning `mention-` are text-mention markers
  (scripture mode); arrows never reference them.
- The slider is `aria-disabled="true"` while scripture mode is active.
- Magnetic drag-release snap: releasing a dragged slider handle within ~6px of an
  era boundary (either neighboring era's own `from_year`/`to_year`) snaps the
  released value to that boundary year; releasing anywhere else keeps the exact
  pixel-decoded year (a deliberate mid-era release is never pulled to a boundary).
  Snapping is evaluated only at the release point -- never while the handle is
  still being dragged, so the brush visibly tracks the pointer exactly until the
  pointer is lifted.
